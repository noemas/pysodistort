#pysodistort

This script contains two functions which you can use as a small api for the ISODISTORT program of the ISOTROPY software suite (http://stokes.byu.edu/iso/isotropy.php). It consists of two functions: one to submit the structures to the ISODISTORT program and one to extract the amplitude from the resulting html file.
